# Kernel Browser

A mixin kit (`kind: mixin`) that gives any Docker Sandbox agent access to
[Kernel](https://www.kernel.sh/) cloud browsers. The kit installs the Kernel
CLI, adds an agent quick-reference guide, and routes API authentication through
the sandbox proxy so the real credential never enters the sandbox.

## Prerequisites

Create a [Kernel](https://www.kernel.sh/) account and store its API key once in
Docker Sandboxes' host-side secret store:

```console
sbx secret set kernel
```

## Usage

The primary form is the published OCI artifact on Docker Hub:

```console
sbx run --kit "docker.io/sbx/kernel-kit:latest" claude
```

Or target this repo directly over git:

```console
sbx run --kit "git+https://github.com/docker/sbx-kits-contrib.git#dir=kernel" claude
```

Or use a local clone:

```console
sbx run --kit ./kernel/ claude
```

Mix it with another kit by repeating `--kit`:

```console
sbx run --kit ./kernel/ --kit ./ruff-lint/ claude
```

The kit works with any agent that ships npm. It installs the `kernel` CLI
globally so the agent can run `kernel browsers create`, `kernel browsers list`,
and so on directly from the terminal.

A quick-reference guide is dropped at `/home/agent/.kernel/quickstart.md`
on every sandbox start.

## Adding the SDK to your project

The kit installs the CLI but not the SDK — that belongs in your project's
`package.json` or `requirements.txt`:

**TypeScript / JavaScript:**

```console
npm install @onkernel/sdk playwright-core
```

Use `playwright-core` (not `playwright`): it provides `connectOverCDP` without
downloading local Chromium binaries that you won't use.

**Python:**

```console
PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1 pip install kernel playwright
```

## How auth works

The kit declares two things:

- `credentials[].apiKey.inject` maps `api.onkernel.com` to the `kernel`
  credential, telling the proxy to inject `Authorization: Bearer <key>` on
  outbound requests to that host.
- `permissions.network.allow` uses `*.onkernel.com` to also permit CDP
  WebSocket proxy URLs (`wss://proxy.<region>.onkernel.com:8443/...`),
  which don't get auth injection.

The inject domain is intentionally narrow (just the REST API host). A wildcard
there would put the proxy into TLS-intercept mode for all `*.onkernel.com`
traffic — including the CDP WebSocket connections that carry browser data —
which would corrupt them.

`KERNEL_API_KEY` is declared with `apiKey.proxyManaged: true`: the sandbox
holds a placeholder value; the proxy substitutes the real credential at
request time. The real key comes from the host secret stored under the
`kernel` service name.

## What gets installed

| Component | Location | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kernel` CLI | `/usr/local/bin/kernel` (global) | `npm install -g @onkernel/cli` at creation time |
| Quick-reference guide | `/home/agent/.kernel/quickstart.md` | Static file from `files/` |

## Cleanup

The kit creates no persistent host-side state. Browser sessions created inside
the sandbox are scoped to your Kernel organization and can be deleted from the
[Kernel dashboard](https://www.kernel.sh/) or with `kernel browsers delete <id>`.
